### Error-free Application

This mobile handle error within the app with care so that users don't worry about the error that have to face.

Using error-handling technique defined as below:

```swift
    // Define
    func getAnimes(_ completion: @escaping (Result<[FavouriteAnime], Error>) -> Void {
        try {
            // Logic here
            completion(.success(animes))
        } catch let error {
            completion(.failure(error))
        }

    }

    // Implementation
    getAnimes {result in 
        switch result:
            case .success(let animes):
                // Handle success here
            case .failure(let error):
                // Handle error here
    })
}
```

Using **Result** struct approach that is provided by Apple, give us the developers to transfer data and error to the whichever functions that are going to use. This allow error-handling at the View Model layer, which the error can be converted to a readable message for general users.
